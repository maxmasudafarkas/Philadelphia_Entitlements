The objective of this project is to quantify, visualize, and predict zoning approvals and rejections in Philadelphia.

This project draws upon three primary datasets: (1) a [dataset][https://www.opendataphilly.org/dataset/licenses-and-inspections-building-permits/resource/bf031e58-a3b6-436e-b0d5-d799c520b874] containing zoning permit issuances by the [Department of Licenses and Inspections][https://www.phila.gov/departments/department-of-licenses-and-inspections/] (L&I), (2) a [dataset][https://www.opendataphilly.org/dataset/license-and-inspections-appeals/resource/5cf0641c-d354-44cf-acaf-4a48ea8661ad] containing the zoning permit appeals decisions by the [Zoning Board of Adjustment][https://www.phila.gov/departments/zoning-board-of-adjustment/] (ZBA), and (3) a [dataset][https://www.opendataphilly.org/dataset/opa-property-assessments/resource/6fd97fd3-3d0a-4eb3-b9c8-87a91f4bfeff] from the [Office of Property Assessment][https://www.phila.gov/departments/office-of-property-assessment/] related to property data in Philadelphia.

This project is divided into three related parts:

1. An exploratory analysis of zoning permits issued by L&I
2. An analysis and mapping of zoning appeals decisions by ZBA
3. A machine learning model that predicts zoning appeals decision outcomes based on property features
